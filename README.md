# Unmochon-Online-University-Project-Showcase-Platform
Project Overview – Unmochon

Unmochon is a university project showcase management platform.

It helps universities organize, manage, and evaluate project showcase events efficiently.

Students can submit projects in multiple stages (idea → prototype → final), upload GitHub links, and receive feedback.

Faculty and evaluators can review projects based on outcome, presentation, and technology.

The system uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with different dashboards for students, faculty, evaluators, and organizers.
